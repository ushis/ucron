# ucron

**unprivileged cron** aka **ushi's cron**

A cron implementation meant to be executed by unprivileged users. The project aims to provide a hassle free solution for running cron inside a docker container.

## Install

```shell
$ go get github.com/ushis/ucron
```

## Usage

```shell
$ ucron path/to/crontab
> /bin/sh -c "echo my first job"
my first job
```

## Features / Design

- No root required
- Reads a single crontab from file or stdin
- Logs all job output to stdout
- Waits for all running jobs to complete on shutdown

## Q&A

**Is ucron capable of running multiple crontabs?** Of course!

```shell
$ cat crontab1 crontab2 crontab3 | ucron -
```
